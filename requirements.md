# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GradeCompass is a polished, user-friendly web application designed to help students track their academic progress and predict future grade outcomes. The application allows students to input grade components for their courses, enter scores for completed assessments, and receive real-time feedback on their current grade and what scores they need on remaining components to achieve their target grades. The app features dynamic visualizations and responsive design to provide an intuitive academic planning experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to dynamically add and remove grade components for my course, so that I can accurately represent my course's grading structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the grade component input section THEN the system SHALL display an interface to add new grade components
2. WHEN a user adds a grade component THEN the system SHALL allow input of component name, weight percentage, and optional score
3. WHEN a user wants to remove a component THEN the system SHALL provide a delete option for each component
4. WHEN the total weight of all components exceeds 100% THEN the system SHALL display a validation error
5. WHEN the total weight is less than 100% THEN the system SHALL show the remaining percentage needed
6. WHEN a user enters negative weight values THEN the system SHALL prevent the input and show an error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see my current weighted grade calculated in real-time, so that I can understand my current academic standing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters scores for completed components THEN the system SHALL calculate the current weighted average automatically
2. WHEN a user modifies any score or weight THEN the system SHALL update the calculation immediately
3. WHEN no scores are entered THEN the system SHALL display "No grades entered yet" or similar message
4. WHEN only partial scores are available THEN the system SHALL calculate based on completed components only
5. WHEN all components have scores THEN the system SHALL display the final course grade

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to set a target grade and see what scores I need on remaining assessments, so that I can plan my study efforts effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a target grade percentage THEN the system SHALL calculate required scores for remaining components
2. WHEN the target grade is achievable THEN the system SHALL display the minimum average needed on remaining assessments
3. WHEN the target grade is impossible to achieve THEN the system SHALL display a friendly error message with suggestions
4. WHEN there are no remaining components THEN the system SHALL show whether the target has been met
5. WHEN the user changes the target grade THEN the system SHALL recalculate requirements immediately
6. WHEN remaining assessments are insufficient to reach the target THEN the system SHALL warn the user appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see a visual representation of my grade breakdown, so that I can quickly understand my progress at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN grade components are entered THEN the system SHALL display a dynamic pie chart
2. WHEN components have scores THEN the system SHALL show completed portions in distinct colors
3. WHEN components are pending THEN the system SHALL show them in a different visual style
4. WHEN data changes THEN the system SHALL update the chart automatically
5. WHEN hovering over chart sections THEN the system SHALL display component details in tooltips
6. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate placeholder

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student using various devices, I want the application to work seamlessly on desktop and mobile, so that I can access it anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the app on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a full-featured layout
2. WHEN accessing the app on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt to smaller screen sizes
3. WHEN switching between orientations THEN the system SHALL maintain usability
4. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets
5. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL respond fluidly without breaking layout

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want my grade data to persist between sessions, so that I don't lose my work when I close the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters grade data THEN the system SHALL save it to local storage automatically
2. WHEN a user returns to the app THEN the system SHALL restore their previous data
3. WHEN local storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL function without persistence and inform the user
4. WHEN a user wants to clear their data THEN the system SHALL provide a clear data option
5. WHEN data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and start fresh

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student managing multiple courses, I want to track grades for different courses separately, so that I can organize my academic progress effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to add a new course THEN the system SHALL provide an option to create additional course trackers
2. WHEN switching between courses THEN the system SHALL maintain separate data for each course
3. WHEN viewing course list THEN the system SHALL display course names and current grades
4. WHEN deleting a course THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and remove all associated data
5. WHEN no courses exist THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to create their first course

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a student, I want clear error messages and validation feedback, so that I can correct mistakes and use the app effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is entered THEN the system SHALL display specific, helpful error messages
2. WHEN required fields are empty THEN the system SHALL indicate which fields need attention
3. WHEN calculations cannot be performed THEN the system SHALL explain why and suggest solutions
4. WHEN the app encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL provide positive feedback or clear the error state
